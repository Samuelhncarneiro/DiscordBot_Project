# DiscordBot_Project
A discord Bot with machine learning

This Project consists in the creation of a virtual assistant for the Curricular Unit
of Network System Management. This Assistance will be through the creation of a Bot
given access to both students and teachers. Being a time when the number of Higher
Education students has been rising rapidly, the individual assistance given by Professors
is often impossible for many students, reducing interest and, consequently, grades. This
project mainly consists of creating a Bot on the Discord platform consisting of a
Gamification, Game-based Learning and Real Time Feedback system. This virtual
assistant will be created using the Discord platform and implemented using the Python
programming language and Discord Bot APIs.
